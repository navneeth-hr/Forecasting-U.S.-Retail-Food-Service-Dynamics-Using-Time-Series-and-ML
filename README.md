## **Overview**

The **U.S. Retail & Food Service Forecasting Dashboard** provides users with the ability to:
- Analyze historical data.
- Generate forecasts using advanced machine learning and statistical models.
- Visualize predictions and compare model performance.

The dashboard integrates with external CSV files, such as future exogenous variable predictions, to enhance forecast accuracy.

## **Features**

- **File Uploader**: Upload datasets for custom analysis.
- **Forecast Configurations**: Set up short-term and long-term predictions.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Adjust model-specific parameters for optimization.
- **Exogenous Variable Integration**: Use external predictors to improve forecasting accuracy.
- **Visualization**: Generate clear and interactive plots for historical data, predictions, and future trends.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Assess model performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and RÂ².

## **Models Implemented**

The dashboard supports the following forecasting models:
1. **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**:
   - Utilizes neural networks for sequential data forecasting.
   - Supports MinMax scaling and future prediction capabilities.
   - Implements `EarlyStopping` for optimized training.
2. **Prophet**: A Bayesian model designed for time series forecasting with seasonality and trend adjustments.
3. **Random Forest**: A tree-based ensemble machine learning algorithm.
4. **Holt's Winter**: A statistical method incorporating trend and seasonal components.
5. **SARIMAX (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous variables)**: Combines ARIMA with seasonal and external predictors.

Each model script is modularized for easy updates and reuse:
- `lstm_model.py`
- `prophet_model.py`
- `random_forest_model.py`
- `holts_winter_model.py`
- `sarima_model.py`
